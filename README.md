ðŸ§  Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST)

This project implements Handwritten Digit Recognition using the MNIST dataset
.
It includes training both a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), comparing their performance, visualizing results, and deploying with Streamlit.

âš¡ Features

Load and preprocess MNIST dataset

Train and evaluate MLP and CNN models

Compare performance (MLP vs CNN)

Plot accuracy & loss curves

Visualize predictions with correct/incorrect coloring

Generate confusion matrix + classification report

Save the CNN model (cnn_mnist.h5) for deployment

Deploy an interactive app with Streamlit

ðŸš€ How to Run Training

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Melissiasamir/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition.git
cd Handwritten-Digit-Recognition


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the training script:

python main.py


After training, the model will be saved automatically as:

saved_models/cnn_mnist.h5


ðŸ“ˆ Results

MLP Test Accuracy: ~97â€“98%

CNN Test Accuracy: ~99% âœ…

ðŸ‘‰ CNN consistently performs better than MLP for handwritten digit recognition.

Example output:

Accuracy & Loss plots during training

Confusion Matrix

Predictions with green (correct) / red (incorrect) labels

ðŸ”® Run the Streamlit App

After training and saving the model, you can launch the interactive app:

streamlit run app.py


Features:

ðŸŽ¨ Draw digits on a canvas

ðŸ“¤ Upload digit images

ðŸ”® Predict digit with probability chart
